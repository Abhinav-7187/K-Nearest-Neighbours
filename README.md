### K-Nearest-Neighbours
The Iris dataset is a classic machine learning dataset that contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species.
The Iris dataset is a built-in dataset in R that contains measurements on four different attributes (in centimeters) for 50 flowers from three different species.
The dataset contains four features for each flower: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width.
The goal of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.

K-Nearest Neighbour classification algorithm is being used in this iris dataset to classify different species of iris flowers namely
iris Setosa, iris Versicolour and iris Virginica.
